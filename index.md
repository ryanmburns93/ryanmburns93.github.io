## Project Repositories

### Recording and Transcription Web Scraping Toolkit

I developed this toolkit to automate the collection of video recordings, recording metadata, and transcripts from a variety of different video conference, video hosting, and transcription service platforms. I personally utilized the tools during my four years working in client relationship management remotely supporting a territory containing hundreds of clients.

### NLP Miniature BERT Model Case Study

This project is a case study on developing NLP applications in a low-resource corporate environment operating a client-centric, service-based business model. I pretrained miniature BERT masked language models on domain-adapted vocabulary sourced from client-facing research documents. I demonstrated light improvements in model performance over baseline when finetuned to categorize client consultation requests by topic.

### PDGA Prediction Modeling Utility Scripts

I co-authored a blog series hosted on Ultiworld Disc Golf predicting disc golf player performance at elite series events. I contributed player performance web scraping and GIS data collection capabilities, cleaned and preprocessed data, and edited post content. The scripts hosted in this repository demonstrate some of the larger data collection efforts feeding parts of the model. This was my first time ever using Python, and I am in the process of revisiting the files to spruce up the content.
